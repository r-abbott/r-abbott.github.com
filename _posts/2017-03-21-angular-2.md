This is a multi-part post that will take a look into the latest Javascript frameworks:
- [Angular 2](https://angular.io)
- [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io)
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org)

[Part 1 - Installation]({% raw %} {{ {% endraw %} site.url {% raw %} }} {% endraw %}/2017-03-14-a-look-into-the-latest-javascript-frameworks-installation)

The overall repository can be found [here](https://github.com/r-abbott/JSFrameworks-EventManager).
The Angular specific repository can be found [here](https://github.com/r-abbott/JSFrameworks-EventManager/tree/master/em-angular).

This post will cover building a an API backed web application with Angular 2.

<h2>Overivew</h2>

The Angular [Quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cli-quickstart.html) really does a great job of describing the project structure, so I don't feel it necessary to repeat what they say here.

The application I am building is a pretty simple Event management application. It has 2 views: an Events listing view, and an Event detail view.

Event Listing
<img src="{% raw %} {{ {% endraw %} site.url {% raw %} }} {% endraw %}/assets/2017-03-21/EventListingView.PNG" alt="Event Listing View" style="width: 600px;"/>

The requirements of this view are:
- List each Event and display the Date, Name, and the Price of the Event.
- If the Event's Price is $0, display "FREE" instead of the Price. Otherwise, display the formatted USD Price.
- The New Event button will navigate to the Detail view for a New Event.
- Clicking on an Event will navigate to the Details view of that Event.

Event Detail
<img src="{% raw %} {{ {% endraw %} site.url {% raw %} }} {% endraw %}/assets/2017-03-21/EventDetailView.PNG" alt="Event Listing View" style="width: 600px;"/>

The requirements of this view are:
- Display all of the Event's properties, with the exception of its Id.
- All Fields are editable.
- Each piece of Additional Information should be displayed individually in an text box, with the option of deleting the individual piece.
- Can add more Additional Information as needed
- Back button navigates back to the Event Listing
- Save button saves the Event using the Api, and navigates back to the Event Listing.
- Delete button deletes the Event using the Api, and navigates back to the Event Listing.

The backend is a .Net Core Web API that has the following signature:
- [GET] /events - returns all of the Event Listings
- [GET] /events/{id} - returns the Event Detail of a specific Event
- [POST] /events - creates a new Event
- [PUT] /events/{id} - updates an existing Event
- [DELETE] /events/{id} - deletes an existing Event

<h2>Angular Details</h2>

An Angular application is composed of multiple parts - mainly Modules, Components, and Services.

<h3>Modules</h3>
Modules are the high level parts that group Components together. They are responsible for providing their Components, any Imports those Components need, as well as any Services those Components need.

The app Module is the root Module, and the one used in this application can be seen here:

{% highlight typescript %}
// /src/app/app.module.ts

import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http';
import { CurrencyPipe } from '@angular/common';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { EventListingComponent } from './events/event-listing.component';
import { EventDetailComponent } from './events/event-detail.component';
import { PriceFilterPipe } from './events/price.filter.pipe';

import { HostEventService } from './events/event.service';
import { AppRoutingModule }     from './app-routing.module';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    EventListingComponent,
    EventDetailComponent,
    PriceFilterPipe
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    HttpModule,
    AppRoutingModule
  ],
  providers: [
    HostEventService,
    CurrencyPipe
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
{% endhighlight %}

There are several things going on in this Module.
- At the top are all the imports required of the Module. These are classes from external libraries (angular/core for example), and internal classes (./events/event-listing.component);
- @NgModule() is the decorator used when creating this class. It is configured here to include Declarations, Imports, Providers, and Bootstrap.
- *Declarations* are all of the Components that the Module contains.
- *Imports* are all of the other Modules that the Components need.
- *Providers* are all of the Services that can be injected into Components. Declaring them here defines them as Singletons.
- *Bootstrap* is the initial Component that this Module will load (root Component).

<h3>Components</h3>
Components can be thought of as the individual parts of a View or a View in itself.

Here is a look at the app.component.

{% highlight typescript %}
// /src/app/app.component.ts

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = "Events Manager"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that the layout here is similar to the Module earlier. It has an import section, a decorator, and an export class.

Components are generally made up of 3 files: <name>.component.html (the Html View), <name>.component.css (styling), <name>.component.ts (logic).

In order to define a Component, the Component decorator class is required from the angular/core Module, and therefore is included as an import.
The @Component decorator is configured as follows:
- selector - this the tag that can be used in Html to include this Component, in this case <app-root></app-root>
- templateUrl - url for the Html template that will be used by this Component. Note this could also simply be template, and use in-line Html, as well as multi-line Html using ES6 ``.
- styleUrls - urls for the css files that will be used by this Component. The neat thing here is that the style is *only used by this Component*, therefore each Component can have their own styling, and it does not interfere with other Components. Note this can also be inline similar to templates.

export class AppComponent is the definition of the class for this Component. Here it is named AppComponent.
The class has only one public property on it, *title*, which here is assigned "Events Manager".

Let's go over the template used by this Component.
{% highlight html %}
// /src/app/app.component.html

<h1>
  {% raw %} {{ {% endraw %}title{% raw %} }} {% endraw %}
</h1>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
{% endhighlight %}

Simple enough - it's just displaying the *title* property in a heading tag, and has a <router-outlet> placeholder (more on that later).

But, how does this Component get loaded? Remember that selector? Well, let's go to index.html and take a look.

{% highlight html %}
// /src/index.html

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Event Manager - Angular</title>
  <base href="/">

  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <app-root>Loading...</app-root>
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

Notice the only tag inside the body? That's all you need to wire up the Component to the page.

Okay, that Component wasn't all that interesting, but it does play an important role in the overall application.

Let's take a look at a more complex Component.

{% highlight typescript %}
// /src/app/events/event-listing.component.ts

import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';

import { HostEvent } from './event';
import { HostEventService } from './event.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'event-listing',
  templateUrl: './event-listing.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./event-listing.component.css']
})
export class EventListingComponent implements OnInit {
  title = "Upcoming Events";
  hostEvents: HostEvent[];
  selectedEvent: HostEvent;

  constructor(
    private router: Router,
    private eventService: HostEventService){
  }

  ngOnInit(): void{
    this.getEvents();
  }

  onSelect(event: HostEvent): void{
      this.selectedEvent = event;
      this.router.navigate(['/detail',this.selectedEvent.id]);
  }

  getEvents(): void{
      this.eventService.getEvents()
      .then(events => this.hostEvents = events)
      .catch(this.handleError);
  }

  addEvent(): void{
    this.router.navigate(['/detail']);
  }

  private handleError(error: any): Promise<any>{
        console.error('An error occurred', error);
        return Promise.reject(error.message || error);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is the Component for the Event Listing defined in the requirements earlier. Again, the layout is similar to what we've seen before, however there are a few changes to the class.

*implements OnInit* - this is how classes implement interfaces in Angular. In order to do this, the Component had to import *OnInit* from angular/core first. OnInit is a lifecycle hook that is called in the initialization phase, right after the construction of the object. The ngOnInit() method had to be implemented, and in this case it's simply calling another private method getEvents() to retrieve Events from the *eventService*.

But wait... the getEvents() method is using this.eventService, but there is no property listed in the class! There's only title, hostEvents, and selectedEvent. Actually, it IS in the class, but it's a trick Angular does in the constructor. Marking the input parameters as private (or even public) in the constructor adds them as properties to the class, which can then be used anywhere in the class. And where do those parameters come from? Dependency Injection! Look back at the app.module's providers and imports, these are used to inject parameters into Component's constructors.

One thing to note is that the import has to exist in both the Component and the Module in order to be used. You can't simply import in a Component and not the host Module and expect it to work (I believe the exception is in the case of extension methods through rxjs, but I could be wrong).

Moving along, let's see what this service looks like.

{% highlight typescript %}
// src/app/events/event.service.ts

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Headers, Http } from '@angular/http';

import 'rxjs/add/operator/toPromise';

import { HostEvent } from './event';

@Injectable()
export class HostEventService{
    private eventsUrl = 'http://localhost:51473/api/events';
    private headers = new Headers({'Content-Type':'application/json'});

    constructor(private http: Http) { }

    getEvents(): Promise<HostEvent[]>{
        return this.http
            .get(this.eventsUrl)
            .toPromise()
            .then(response => {
                return response.json() as HostEvent[]
            })
            .catch(this.handleError);
    }

    getEvent(id: number) : Promise<HostEvent>{
        const url = `${this.eventsUrl}/${id}`;
        return this.http
            .get(url)
            .toPromise()
            .then(response => response.json() as HostEvent)
            .catch(this.handleError);
    }

    add(hostEvent: HostEvent) : Promise<HostEvent>{
        return this.http
            .post(this.eventsUrl, JSON.stringify(hostEvent), {headers: this.headers})
            .toPromise()
            .then(()=>hostEvent)
            .catch(this.handleError);
    }

    update(hostEvent: HostEvent) : Promise<HostEvent>{
        const url = `${this.eventsUrl}/${hostEvent.id}`;
        return this.http
            .put(url, JSON.stringify(hostEvent), {headers: this.headers})
            .toPromise()
            .then(()=>hostEvent)
            .catch(this.handleError);
    }

    delete(hostEvent: HostEvent) : Promise<void>{
        const url = `${this.eventsUrl}/${hostEvent.id}`;
        return this.http
            .delete(url)
            .toPromise()
            .then(() => null)
            .catch(this.handleError);
    }

    private handleError(error: any): Promise<any>{
        console.error('An error occurred', error);
        return Promise.reject(error.message || error);
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

By now you should notice the pattern for Angular files. Import/Decorator/Class.

This class is what's calling the external API to retrieve Events data. In order to do that, it requires the Http and Headers classes from angular/http.

Looking at the getEvents() method, it is returning a Promise of type HostEvent[] (the Event Listings). The default return value from http requests is Observable, but Observables do not have a Promise, so an extension method *toPromise()* is used (imported from rxjs/add/operator/toPromise).
The method uses http.get, which sends a GET request to the url, awaits a response, gets the response value as json, and casts it as HostEvent[], and returns to the caller. If there is an error, it passes it along to handleError() which simply outputs it to the console (in a real application it'd be logged somewhere and a friendly message would be displayed to the user).

The other methods follow a similar structure with post, put, delete requests from http. The only big difference is setting the Content-Type for the post and put requests.

That's about it for the service. What's that? Oh, that @Injectable decorator up there? Remember when I said the Module injects the classes into Components? Well, this decorator is required when you need parameters injected into the constructor. But what about @Component, why didn't we use @Injectable there? That's because @Component is a subtype of @Injectable.

So now the Event Listing compent retrieved the Events, here is how it gets displayed.

{% highlight html %}
// /src/app/events/event-listing.component.html

<h1>{% raw %} {{ {% endraw %}title{% raw %} }} {% endraw %}</h1>
<button (click)="addEvent()">New Event</button>
<ul class="events">
    <li *ngFor="let hostEvent of hostEvents" 
        [class.selected]="hostEvent === selectedEvent"
        (click)="onSelect(hostEvent)">
        <span class="badge">{% raw %} {{ {% endraw %}hostEvent.date{% raw %} }} {% endraw %}</span> {% raw %} {{ {% endraw %}hostEvent.name{% raw %} }} {% endraw %} <span class="price">{% raw %} {{ {% endraw %} hostEvent.price | priceFilter {% raw %} }} {% endraw %}</span>
    </li>
</ul>

{% endhighlight %}

Similar to the app Component, it is displaying the title in a heading tag. There is also a list here, and each list item has an attribute of *ngFor on it. ngFor tells the template engine to create an element for each items in a collection, described by "let hostEvent of hostEvents". Notice it isn't "let hostEvent IN hostEvents" which is a common mistake.

Also, there is a {% raw %}[class.selected]{% endraw %} attribute - this sets the element to have a class of selected based on the condition statement. So, when this hostEvent is the selectedEvent, give the element the "selected" class.
One more attribute, (click), is how the engine wires up the onClick event to a method in the Component, in this case onSelect(hostEvent), which passes the hostEvent to the method.

Each Event then has the required data displayed (date, name, price), but notice a different syntax for the price.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %} {{ {% endraw %} hostEvent.price | priceFilter {% raw %} }} {% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This is known as Piping, and it is useful for inline formatting of data. Angular provides a Currency pipe, which would display the formatted currency, however, the requirements were to display either the currency price, or "FREE", so I had to create my own Pipe.

{% highlight typescript %}
// /src/app/events/price.filter.pipe.ts

import { PipeTransform, Pipe } from '@angular/core';
import { CurrencyPipe } from '@angular/common';


@Pipe({
    name: 'priceFilter'
})
export class PriceFilterPipe implements PipeTransform {

    constructor(private currencyPipe:CurrencyPipe){}

    transform(value: number) : string {
        return value > 0 ? this.currencyPipe.transform(value,'USD',true,'1.2-2') : "FREE";
    }
}

{% endhighlight %}

Simply put - this Pipe implements the PipeTransform in order to be used correctly. However, it also uses the aforementioned Currency Pipe as well.


Binding a form to a model can be done using the [(ngModel)] attribute, like the following:

{% highlight html %}
// /src/app/events/event-detail.component.html

<input [(ngModel)]="hostEvent.name" placeholder="name"/>
{% endhighlight %}

This links the name property of the hostEvent so any updates to it will both reflect in the text box, and any changes to the text box will update the model (2-way binding).

Binding to a collection model property is pretty straightforward too, though it takes two additional parameters in ngFor - index and trackBy:

{% highlight html %}
// /src/app/events/event-detail.component.html

 <div class="indented" *ngIf="hostEvent.additionalInformation.length > 0">
    <div *ngFor="let info of hostEvent.additionalInformation; let i = index;trackBy:additionalInfoTrackBy">
        <input [(ngModel)]="hostEvent.additionalInformation[i]"/>
        <button (click)="deleteInformation(i)">Remove</button>
    </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

let i = index will give the index of the current object in the collection, and trackBy is needed in order to keep focus on the text box when editing, as I found out if you don't have it, any changes to the text box will remove focus (since the model rebinds), and makes it very annoying to enter text.

<h3>Routing</h3>

One last thing is routing. Angular makes it pretty easy to set up routes using the RouterModule and Routes class in angular/router. All that is needed is to configure the routes, and use the RouterModule.forRoot() method:

{% highlight typescript %}
// /src/app/app-routing.module.ts

import { NgModule }             from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { EventDetailComponent }      from './events/event-detail.component';
import { EventListingComponent }  from './events/event-listing.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/events', pathMatch: 'full' },
  { path: 'detail/:id', component: EventDetailComponent },
  { path: 'detail', component: EventDetailComponent },
  { path: 'events',     component: EventListingComponent }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [ RouterModule.forRoot(routes) ],
  exports: [ RouterModule ]
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}

{% endhighlight %}

This sets up the path signature and the responsible Component. Navigating to a route through code can be done using Router's navigate method.

{% highlight typescript %}
this.router.navigate(['/detail',this.selectedEvent.id]);
{% endhighlight %}

These are all the main pieces needed to get the Angular application running with a WebAPI backend! Feel free to get the code from the [repo](https://github.com/r-abbott/JSFrameworks-EventManager) and check it out yourself.
