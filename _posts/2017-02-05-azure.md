I started messing with Azure today. I wanted to try making a simple blog site using .Net Core. Azure provides templates for Azure Websites that can set up an empty solution, or many other applications depending on what you want. 

I created a site using one of the empty ASP .Net MVC templates, which was pretty painless. It created the application, the SQL Database Server and the SQL Database pretty seamlessly, and I could see the site live. The problem I ran into is that I wanted to get the solution files so I could work on it, but I couldn't find where to do this.

So, I scrapped that site, and started a new .Net Core project using Visual Studio 2015 Community, following [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-vs). 

I had everything set up to push to Azure, but when publishing I ran into an error in Powershell about not being able to find a JSON function. After researching I found that this is most likely due to running x64 version of Visual Studio, but Powershell is loaded in x86 in Visual Studio. This only occurs when I include the database creation in the publish, but without the database there's not much to work with. If I get around to figuring out an alternative I'll make a follow up post.
