Hi, I'm Ryan. I'm a software developer who loves to build solutions that delight people.

Most of the time I'm working with the .Net web stack - C#, ASP.Net MVC, IIS, Entity Framework, and SQL Server. My area of expertise is definitely C#, but I'm not too shabby in the other parts of the stack as well.

I enjoy dabbling with other technologies as well, such as Angular 2, Aurelia, Cypher, Redis, and Linux.

Also, I'm a big fan of [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com) and have gone through many courses, some of which you can see on [my github](https://github.com/r-abbott).
